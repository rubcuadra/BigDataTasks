1) Implementing dimensionality reduction of user vectors with non-negative matrix factorization (and clustering using built-in k-means) 
2) Implementing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (any of it) for clustering of user vectors (with dendograms)
3) Implementing custom friends2vec (an embedding that describes a user's friends in social network based on word2vec) on topics from user's texts using built-in LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
